            <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Alisha Evans and I was born April 14, 2000. 
                I was born in Fresno, California but was raised in different 
                places all over California. I have 1 mom, 1 dad, 2 brothers 
                and 2 sisters. Out of all the kids I 
                am the oldest girl. It goes my oldest brother, me, my first 
                sister, my youngest brother and my youngest sister. </p>

                <p>I love to read nonpublished books, to play and listen to music, I love to
                be outsides and I love to be with my family. I would love to go to Black Sand
                Beach and build a house. I want to visit Venice, Italy one day because it is a beautiful place. 
                I would also like to visit Greece one day because it is also beautiful.</p>
            <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
                <h3>Long term goals</h3>
                    <p>In life everyone has a goal in life long term or short. Here are my long term goals. I
                    would love to be out of Fresno and have a long and healthy life. I do not want to be in poverty 
                    and not have a place to lay at night and somewhere to call home. I do not want to have any problems
                    paying my rent or lease, to not have any problems not having food or being that mom who has
                    her and her kids out on the streets. I want to be able to support myself in the long run and
                    to be able to go without asking for money from anyone.</p>
                    <p>I want to live somewhere outside of California. I want to be able to take care of my family
                    even if they do not like me, I want them to appreciate everything that I do. I want to give my mom 
                    and dad the world even if they did not have the chance to give it to me. I want my siblings to
                    be able to show off they older/younger sister. I want to be able to give them what they want.</p>
                <h3>Short term goals</h3>
                    <p>Here are my short term goals. I want to live a healthy life style, and to be able to do better
                    by myself and not someone else. I want to be able to say, “Yes I did do this and no one helped me.
                    I did it all by myself.” I want to graduate high school top of my class. I want my parents to be 
                    proud of me at the end of high school. I do not want to be hurt anymore by anyone.</p>
                    <p></p>
